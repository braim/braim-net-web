## Concepts

- Linear Equations
  It looks at set of equations and them being represented as a matrix. Few concepts are defined here 
  - Two systems of linear equations are **equivalent** if each equation in each system is a linear combination of the equations in the other system
  - three elelllentary row operations (multi, add , swap)
  - Theorem 1: Equivalent set of matrices have same solution
  - Row Reduced definition
  - Row-Reduced Echelon Matrices
  - elementary matrix (obtainable from identity matrix)
  - Thus if A has a left and a right inverse, A is invertible and has a **unique two-sided inverse**, which we shall simply call the inverse of A. 
  Most important concept of this chapter is Inverse. There some **Theorem** and **Corollary** that are important to know
- Vector Space

  There are some definitions that is important to know enough so we can read articles. There are also some properties that are proved based on definitions. 
  - Subspace
  - Direct Sum ⊕
  - Finite Dimentional Vector Spaces
  - Span
  - Linear Independence
  - Bases
  - Dimension

- Linear Mapping
  - Null Space
  - Injective
  - Range
  - Surjective [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function)
  - Matrix Row Rank and Column Rank
