## Concepts

- Vector Space

  There are some definitions that is important to know enough so we can read articles. There are also some properties that are proved based on definitions. 
  - Subspace

  - Span
  - Linear Independence
  - Bases
  - Dimension

- Linear Mapping
  - Null Space
  - Injective
  - Range
  - Surjective
  - Matrix Row Rank and Column Rank
